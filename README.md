# FIJI-Macros üî¨

A collection of custom **Fiji (ImageJ)** macros to automate common microscopy image workflows: merging / montage / format conversion / projection, etc.

---

## Overview

FIJI-Macros is a lightweight suite of ImageJ macros that simplify repetitive image processing tasks, especially for multi-channel microscopy data.  
Use cases include:

- Converting image formats (TIF / PNG / ND2 / CZI ‚Üí JPG)  
- Generating maximum intensity projections in batch  
- Building per-channel montage images  
- And more to come‚Ä¶

Each macro is standalone and designed for easy modification and extension.

## Macros Included

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the scripts currently in the repo:

| Macro file | Purpose | Key features / notes |
|------------|---------|------------------------|
| `TIF_PNG_GIF_ND2_CZI-to_JPG.ijm` | Format conversion | Takes a folder of various image formats and batch-converts to JPG |
| `Batch-MaxIntensityProjection.ijm` | Batch projection | Automatically opens images, does maximum intensity projection, saves output |
| `Montage Builder per Channel.ijm` | Montage builder | Splits channels, merges, makes montage per channel plus composite |

You can open each macro in Fiji‚Äôs macro editor to view or modify the logic (e.g. LUT assignment, scale bar, saving options).

## Installation / Setup

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. In Fiji, go to **Plugins ‚Üí Macros ‚Üí Install‚Ä¶**, then select one of the `.ijm` files.  
3. The macro will appear in the **Plugins / Macros** menu.  
4. Adjust parameters (e.g. scale bar length) when prompted by the macro dialogs.

Tip: keep backups of raw images. Test on a small sample first.

## Usage Examples

### Format conversion

Open `TIF_PNG_GIF_ND2_CZI-to-JPG.ijm` via **Plugins ‚Üí Macros ‚Üí Run‚Ä¶**  
The macro will convert all supported formats to JPG.

### Montage & Projection

Run `Montage Builder per Channel.ijm`.  
You will be asked to choose an image, then set scalebar size. The macro splits channels, applies color, merges, stacks, and builds a montage (including composite).  
After finishing, it prompts for save format (tif/png/jpg).
